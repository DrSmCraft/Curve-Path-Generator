# Curve-Path-Generator


A Curve generator for FRC PowerUp. Made for Team 2791 and based off of Team 340's pathing code.
To use run "main.py".
After every change, press "Update"


Good to know:
-This is not very accurate at generating code. This will change in future. This app is accurate at displaying paths; it should be used to visualize paths.
-Copy and Paste is not supported (Working on that). Code is written to "code.txt". You can copy it there. It is okay to delete "code.txt" to clear all text.
-Reset Button doesn't work
-Alliance selection doesnt work


This app was not tested extensively. Let me know of bugs and glitches.
